# rpi-relaycontrol
Raspberry Pi Relay Control

This is just a simple relay control program to turn multiple pins on and off simultaneously from the command line on a Raspberry Pi. 

The program requires the wiringPi library and must be run as root. It's as simple as it gets. See code remarks for more details.

Note that there are some lines of code that are not needed or not completed, such as the error variables. I have used this code as the base for some other projects which I will likely publish in the future. Some remnants of testing/debugging and other stuff remain in the code.
